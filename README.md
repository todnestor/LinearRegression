# LinearRegression
A repo for my ZZSC5806 files

* The purpose of this repo is two fold: 
    1. to determine whether version control is worth the effort
    
    2. to maintain my Applied Linear Regression projects in this repo
    
    3. to prove that I havent learnt to count!

* Anyway, I'd like to be one of the "cool kids!"
